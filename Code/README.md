The other files are:
* Audio_Communication.ipynb - A game setup in which two agents play a discrimination game by communicating via audio messages.
* Text_Communication.ipynb - A game setup in which two agents play a discrimination game by communicating via symbolic messages.
* Prep_Data.ipynb - Used to pre-process the raw digit recordings to those included in the data subdirectory.
* Comm_Success_Eval.ipynb - Notebook used to compare the communication success achieved in the audio and symbolic setup.
