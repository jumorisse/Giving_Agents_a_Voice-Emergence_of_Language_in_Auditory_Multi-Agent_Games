## Giving Agents a Voice: Emergence of Language in Auditory Multi-Agent Games

Repository for the course project in the Audio Processing & Indexing course at Leiden University in the fall term 22.

The repository contains an extended version of the EGG toolkit provided in https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG . It further contains all code used to implement audio communication in multi-agent games, compare it to textual communication and produce plots.

A detailled description of each file can be found in the subdirectories.





Abstract of the project paper: \\
Language is a key part of intelligence. To better understand its emergence, use, and development language formation can be simulated in multi-agent games. Previous work has explored many such setups but communication between agents was always implemented as exchange of symbolic sequences. Considering that natural languages emerged not as textual but as gestural and auditory communication, I argue this to be a severe limitation. I propose an extension to an existing framework for studies on language emergence in multi-agent games that allows agents to communicate via audio signals. Performing an initial experiment, I find agents to be benefiting from auditory communication. Agents learn faster, achieve higher success in playing their game, and do so more robustly across several random seeds. Considering these results, I encourage further work that investigates language emergence in auditory multi-agent games.
